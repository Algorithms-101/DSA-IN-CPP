Question 8: FUNCTION

a. Write a function that accepts no arguments and prints a random number.

b. Write a function that returns a random interger from min to max. It accepts min and max as arguments.

c. Write a function that computes and return the average of 2 numbers provided as arguments

d. Write a function that returns an average of n random intergers from min to max. it accepts min,max and n as arguments. (Use one of the above functions.)

e. Write a function that accepts 2 reference varaible a and b as arguments, and uses them to "return" 2 random numbers nE[b,b=18]
and mE[a,a=55].

f.Write a function that asks a user for min and max.
  Use one of the above function to get the average of 1000 random integers from min to max.
  Use one of the above function to average min and max.
  prints the results. What do you observe.
