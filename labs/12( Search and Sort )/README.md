Question 12: SEARCH AND SORT

a. Write a function that accepts array of numbers sorted in the ascending order and its size.The function returns the largest in the array.

b. Write a function that accepts an array of intergers, its size and another interger. The array is sorted in ascending order. The function uses the binary search to find the index of the interger in the araay. Return the index.

c. Write a function that accepts an array of number, its size and another number. The function uses the linear sewarch to return the index of the number in the array that is the closest to the given number. E.g. Array: {22,54,3,77,89} Number: 74 Return: 3

d. Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and its size. The function sorts the array in the ascending order using the bubble sort. The Function returns the number of element comparisons it performed.

e. Write a function that implements the selection sort as described in the book. The function returns the number of element comparisons it performed.

f. *Write a recursive version of the function in part b. (You may accepts more arguments.)
